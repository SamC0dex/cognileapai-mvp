## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### Option 1: Full Implementation (Recommended)
Execute all phases sequentially for complete implementation.

**Time**: 13-18 hours total
**Approach**: Dedicated implementation session(s)

**Steps**:
1. Read `MASTER_PLAN.md` to understand the big picture
2. Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` step-by-step
3. Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)
4. Progress through each phase sequentially
5. Update `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` after each phase
6. Test thoroughly at each checkpoint

---

### Option 2: Phased Implementation
Break into multiple sessions with clear checkpoints.

**Phase 1 + 2**: Authentication System (Day 1: 4-6 hours)
- Set up auth infrastructure
- Build auth pages
- Test complete auth flow
- ✅ Checkpoint: Users can sign up and sign in

**Phase 3**: Landing Page Structure (Day 2: 3-4 hours)
- Build all landing components
- Add content and copy
- Test responsive design
- ✅ Checkpoint: Landing page complete (no animations)

**Phase 4**: Animations & Polish (Day 3: 2-3 hours)
- Add scroll animations
- Add hover effects
- Polish design
- ✅ Checkpoint: Landing page beautiful and smooth

**Phase 5 + 6**: Integration & Optimization (Day 4: 3-5 hours)
- Update API routes
- Test user isolation
- Optimize performance
- ✅ Checkpoint: Production ready

---

### Option 3: Parallel Implementation
Efficient for multiple developers or context windows.

**Track 1: Authentication** (Phase 1 + 2)
- Can be implemented independently
- Critical for user access

**Track 2: Landing Page** (Phase 3 + 4)
- Can be implemented in parallel
- Not dependent on auth

**Track 3: Integration** (Phase 5 + 6)
- Requires both tracks complete
- Final testing and polish

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### After Phase 1 (Foundation)
1. Create 2 test users in Supabase
2. Run RLS verification queries
3. Verify middleware redirects work
4. Check for TypeScript errors

### After Phase 2 (Auth Pages)
1. Test sign-up flow (email + Google)
2. Test sign-in flow (email + Google)
3. Test forgot password
4. Test session persistence
5. Verify protected routes work

### After Phase 3 (Landing)
1. Test all sections render
2. Test responsive design
3. Test dark/light mode
4. Test all links work
5. Verify no console errors

### After Phase 5 (Integration)
1. Create test document as User A
2. Sign out, sign in as User B
3. Verify User B cannot see User A's document
4. Test all existing features
5. Verify no breaking changes

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If TypeScript Errors
1. Run `pnpm typecheck` to see all errors
2. Check import paths are correct
3. Verify all required types are defined
4. Check `tsconfig.json` hasn't changed

### If Auth Not Working
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify Supabase URL and keys
3. Check middleware is running
4. Check browser cookies are enabled
5. Review Supabase Auth logs

### If RLS Blocking Access
1. Check user is authenticated
2. Verify user_id is being set
3. Check RLS policies in Supabase
4. Test queries in SQL Editor with `SET request.jwt.claims`

### If Animations Stuttering
1. Check for console errors
2. Verify GPU acceleration (use transforms, not position)
3. Reduce animation complexity
4. Test on different devices

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Efficient Implementation
1. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Commit often** - After each successful step
3. **Read docs first** - Don't skip the planning docs
4. **Use TypeScript** - Let the compiler catch errors
5. **Check existing patterns** - Follow codebase conventions

### For Context Window Management
1. **Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** after each phase
2. **Commit before ending session**
3. **Note any blockers** in progress tracker
4. **Start new session** by reading progress tracker
5. **Continue from last checkpoint**

### For Quality Assurance
1. **Test on real devices** - Not just Chrome DevTools
2. **Test with real users** - Get feedback early
3. **Monitor performance** - Use Lighthouse
4. **Check accessibility** - Use axe DevTools
5. **Review security** - Test RLS thoroughly
