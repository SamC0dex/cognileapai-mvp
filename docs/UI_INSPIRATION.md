# UI Inspiration â†’ CogniLeap Translation

Sources: NotebookLM, Penseum.

We borrow:
- Card-based clarity and structure (NotebookLM)
- Sidebar navigation and course/doc cards (Penseum)
- Calm dark theme and clean typography (both)

We add:
- Teal/Amber accents with solid surfaces
- Subtle, short animations (<180ms)
- Outline-first right pane with cards per section
- Export bar with quiet success feedback

We avoid:
- AI gradients/glass/neumorphism
- Overly playful micro-interactions
- No Purple color, No default AI design.
