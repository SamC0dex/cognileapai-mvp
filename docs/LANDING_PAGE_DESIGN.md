```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Layout**: Accordion (Radix UI Accordion)

**FAQs**:

#### Q1: How does the AI work?
```
Our AI uses Google's advanced Gemini models to understand and analyze
your documents. It identifies key concepts, relationships, and important
information to generate comprehensive study materials. The AI reads your
PDFs just like a human would, but much faster and more thoroughly.
```

#### Q2: Is my data secure and private?
```
Absolutely. Your documents are encrypted in transit and at rest. We use
Supabase's enterprise-grade security with Row Level Security, ensuring
your data is completely isolated from other users. You can delete your
documents anytime, and we never use your data to train AI models.
```

#### Q3: What file formats are supported?
```
Currently, we support PDF files of any size. Support for additional
formats (DOCX, PPTX, EPUB) is coming soon. Your PDFs can be textbooks,
research papers, lecture notes, articles, or any educational content.
```

#### Q4: Is CogniLeap AI really free?
```
Yes! Our core features are completely free forever. We believe everyone
should have access to AI-powered learning tools. No credit card required,
no hidden fees, no catch. Premium features may be added in the future,
but the free tier will always be robust.
```

#### Q5: How accurate are the study materials?
```
Our AI achieves high accuracy by using advanced language models and
semantic understanding. However, we always recommend reviewing generated
materials and using them as a study aid rather than a replacement for
reading your source materials. You can always chat with your documents
to clarify any points.
```

#### Q6: Can I use it for any subject?
```
Yes! CogniLeap AI works with any subject—science, mathematics, history,
literature, law, medicine, and more. Our AI is trained on a broad range
of topics and can understand specialized terminology and concepts across
all disciplines.
```

#### Q7: How long does it take to process a document?
```
Most PDFs are processed in 30-60 seconds, depending on size. Study guide
generation takes another 30-60 seconds. Flashcards and summaries are
typically ready in under a minute. All generation happens in real-time
with progress indicators.
```

#### Q8: Can I customize the study materials?
```
Yes! You can customize flashcard difficulty, number of cards, and provide
specific instructions for what you want to focus on. You can also edit
and refine generated materials directly in the app.
```
