PROMPT 1: 

> Before building or improving this layout, take a step back and observe every element on the screen — navigation, headers, cards, buttons, sidebars, text blocks — everything that occupies space. Imagine each of them as a box and describe how they relate to one another: which boxes contain others, how they align, and how space flows between them. Focus on relationships, not visuals. The layout should feel organized and stable, even if resized.Then, structure it so these elements can be rearranged or re-ordered naturally when the available space changes — without breaking their balance.

PROMPT 2: 

> Now, describe how this layout behaves when the screen or container changes size. Think in terms of movement, proportion, and flow, not pixels. Which sections move above or below others? Which expand, and which step back? Important areas — like navigation or hero sections — should retain priority, while secondary ones can compress or shift. Imagine the layout using smart rules: margins that scale, gaps that stay consistent, and columns that merge into rows when space runs out. Keep every change purposeful — the layout shouldn’t feel like it’s shrinking, it should feel like it’s breathing and reorganizing itself.
